# introduction to causal inference

**instructor:** direnç erşahin  
**meetings:** online via zoom. Monday evenings - 19:00 to 21:45         
**prerequisites:** no distinct prerequisites other than a genuine interest on the subject.   

### i.aim   
The course consists of three modules. These modules intends to provide an introduction to the basics of causality, which have long been a primary issue of interest for both philosophy and science. Recent developments on the topic paved the way for a wider utilisation of causal inference in various fields, including machine learning, data science, economics, and epidemiology. By implementing and interpreting causal inference methods, we will address a practical understanding of causal analysis.  

*keywords:* Causality. Causal inference.  Causal graphs. Potential outcomes. Causal inference methods. Structural Causal Models. Interventions. *Do*-calculus. Counterfactuals.  

### ii. content   
The course will try to address the following issue: why we do what we do, when we are running a causal study.   

### iii. course plan   
The meetings will be held online, via zoom. Discussions will be primarily in Turkish. However, since all the material is in English, fluency in both languages is required.
