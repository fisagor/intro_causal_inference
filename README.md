# Introduction to Causal Inference

*İzlencenin pdf versiyonu [burada](ICI_syllabus.pdf). Eğer seminere katılmak isterseniz direnc.ersahin@tedu.edu.tr'a ilginizi açıklayan kısa bir paragrafı içeren bir e-posta atmanızı rica ediyorum. İlk sürümü ufak bir grupla yürütmek arzusundayım. Bu nedenle, eklediğiniz paragraflara başvurarak bir seçim yapmak durumunda kalabilirim.*   

**instructor:** direnç erşahin  
**meetings:** online via zoom. Monday evenings - 19:00 to 21:45 Turkey time (CET 17:00 to 19:45)        
**prerequisites:** no distinct prerequisites other than a genuine interest on the subject.   

### i.aim   
Causality has long been a primary issue of interest for both philosophy and science. Recent developments on the topic paved the way for a wider utilisation of causal inference methods in various fields, including machine learning, economics, and epidemiology. This lecture formation intends to provide an introduction to the basics of causality. By implementing and interpreting causal inference methods, we will try to develop an interdisciplinary and practical understanding of causal analysis.

*keywords:* Causality. Causal inference. Potential outcomes. Bayesian Networks. Structural Causal Models. Interventions. *Do*-calculus. Counterfactuals.  

### ii. content   
This is a less quantitative, seminar version of a 14-week course. The 10-week lecture series is composed of three modules. These modules address the same issue at different levels: why we do what we do, when we are deriving a causal inference. In this context, we will employ why and how questions to probe different causal inference frameworks and methods. <br>
If you would like to take a bite of the seminar content, Kevin Hartnett's exciting Q&A with Judea Pearl might be much helpful: https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/

### iii. course plan   
The meetings will be held online, via zoom. Discussions will be primarily in Turkish. However, since all the material is in English, fluency in both languages is required. Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie's highly influential work, *The Book of Why*, will be the main text we will follow. For most of the weeks, we will read a chapter of this book. Some academic texts, articles and book sections, will accompany to these chapters help us to ground our discussion. I will provide the readings on a weekly basis. I will also offer a number of weekly assignments to implement our findings.
