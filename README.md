# Introduction to Causal Inference

*İzlencenin pdf versiyonu burada. Eğer derse katılmak isterseniz direnc.ersahin@tedu.edu.tr'a ilginizi açıklayan kısa bir paragrafı içeren bir e-posta atmanızı rica ediyorum.*   

**instructor:** direnç erşahin  
**meetings:** online via zoom. Monday evenings - 19:00 to 21:45         
**prerequisites:** no distinct prerequisites other than a genuine interest on the subject.   

### i.aim   
The course consists of three modules. These modules intends to provide an introduction to the basics of causality, which have long been a primary issue of interest for both philosophy and science. Recent developments on the topic paved the way for a wider utilisation of causal inference in various fields, including machine learning, data science, economics, and epidemiology. By implementing and interpreting causal inference methods, we will try to develop a practical understanding of causal analysis.  

*keywords:* Causality. Causal inference. Potential outcomes. Bayesian Networks. Structural Causal Models. Interventions. *Do*-calculus. Counterfactuals.  

### ii. content   
The course will try to address the following issue: why we do what we do, when we are running a causal study. In this context, we will discuss why and how questions ?? causal inference methods. an overall understanding of the topic, which, I hope, will help you to find out how attendants can utilise causal inference methods in their fields.     

### iii. course plan   
The meetings will be held online, via zoom. Discussions will be primarily in Turkish. However, since all the material is in English, fluency in both languages is required. I will provide the readings on a weekly basis. I also plan to record the meetings for those missing any week.
